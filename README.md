### Basic Image Concepts
- A. Digital Images
 An image is made up of tiny squares called pixels (picture elements). Each pixel has a brightness value and color information. Think of it like a mosaic made of tiny colored squares

- B. Color Spaces

  - RGB (Red, Green, Blue):

Every color is made by mixing red, green, and blue
Like mixing paints, but with light
Each color ranges from 0 (none) to 255 (full intensity)
Example: (255, 0, 0) is pure red


  - HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value):

Hue: The actual color (like red, blue, yellow)
Saturation: How pure/intense the color is
Value: How bright or dark the color is
We use HSV because it separates brightness (V) from color information
